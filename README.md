# InvCon: Automated Invariant Generation for Solidity Smart Contracts 
---
The latest version of this repo can be found at.

InvCon is a tool for mining invariant from blockchain transaction data for Solidity smart contracts.

## Prerequisites
+ Linus OS (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
+ TrueBlock (). At least 50 GB disk space required for storing the indexed database provided by trueblock.
+ Python3 (tested on 3.11) 


## Get Started
Clone this repository, install all the python libraries and test on a given examples whose transaction data has been cached.
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/
cd InvCon
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m  invcon.main --address {0xxxx}
```

Time estimation: xx-xx minutes (on modern hardware with good network condition)

If successful, at the end of the command line output should look similar to the following:
```sh
```
